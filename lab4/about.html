		<h1 id="header">Cookies Are <em>GOOD</em> For You</h1>
		<blockquote><p>They are really good, plain, with candies in them, or with icing. Great no matter how your serve them! More technically are small cakes made from stiff, sweet dough rolled and sliced or dropped by spoonfuls on a large, flat pan (cookie sheet)  and baked. MMMMMM!</p></blockquote>

		<h2>How old is that cookie?</h2>
		<p>According to culinary historians, the first historic record of cookies was their use as test cakes. A small amount of cake batter was baked to test the oven temperature. The earliest cookie-style cakes are thought to date back to 7th century Persia A.D. (now Iran), one of the first countries to cultivate sugar (luxurious cakes and pastries in large and small versions were well known in the Persian empire). According to historians, sugar originated either in the lowlands of Bengal or elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Sugar spread to Persia and then to the Eastern Mediterranean. With the Muslim invasion of Spain, then the Crusades and the developing spice trade, the cooking techniques and ingredients of Arabia spread into Northern Europe. </p>
		
		<h3>Different Types of Cookies</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Drop Cookies</strong></dt>
					<dd>The most popular type is the drop cookie. This is the soft dough that kids and adults alike love to spoon onto cookie sheets (and into their mouths). This type of dough is easyto mix and easy to bake. While in the oven, this type of cookie will spread out so when you drop them onto your cookie sheet, you'll want to leave space between them.</dd>
					<dd>Types of cookies in the drop category include the American classic chocolate chip, oatmeal and more.</dd>

			<dt><strong>Molded Cookies</strong></dt>
					<dd>The molded cookie is made with dough that forms a stiff ball and is then rolled into a shape.</dd>
					<dd>This would include the ever popular peanut butter Hershey's kiss cookies which are rolled in the hand into a ball, rolled in sugar and then allowed to bake. When they are just about done, you add the kiss. It will soften and settle into the cookie, but not melt.</dd>

			<dt><strong>Rolled Cookies</strong></dt>
					<dd>The rolled cookie is another classic. Just about everyone has helped mom or grandma roll out a batch of sugar cookies or gingerbread.</dd>
					<dd>Rolled cookies are fun to decorate and make great cookie party favors.</dd>
					<dd>This batter must be mixed with an electric mixer for best results and then cooled in the refrigerator for an hour or more before rolling. This allows the fats to stiffen and makes for an easier to handle dough. These cookies are then cut out with cookie cutters.</dd>

			<dt><strong>Refridgerator Cookies</strong></dt>
					<dd>Refrigerator cookies are very popular especially around the holidays. Black and white checkerboard cookies are made this way. The biscotti is another example of the refrigerator cookie and is actually cut once and then baked twice. Hence the name "biscotti" which means twice baked.</dd>
					<dd>This type of dough is formed into a long log and then chilled to set up. Then, individual cookies are sliced off the roll and baked on a cookie sheet.</dd>

			<dt><strong>Pressed Cookies</strong></dt>
					<dd>Pressed cookies are found in more old school home kitchens. Maybe mom had a cookie press when you were growing up? Often, many Christmas Cookie selections included pressed cookies of some sort.</dd>
					<dd>This type of dough is soft and is squeezed through a press to form various shapes. Christmas trees, squiggles and angels can all be formed by changing out the discs. They are called Spritzgeb√§ck, or Spritz cookies for short.</dd>
					
			<dt><strong>Bar Cookies</strong></dt>
				<dd>Bar cookies are a version many people can remember baking from an early age. The chocolate chip cookie can be transformed into a bar cookie when the batter is pressed into a square or rectangular pan. Layers of gourmet nuts or dried fruit can be added as well.</dd>
					<dd>It's an easy cookie to make since you don't have to continually place cookies on a sheet. The classic brownie and the Rice Krispy treat are also different versions of bar cookies.</dd>

			<dt><strong>Sandwich Cookies</strong></dt>
				<dd>Two cookie halves pressed together make sandwich cookies. These can be filled with ice cream, jelly, peanut butter, fluff or frosting.</dd>
					<dd>Sandwich cookies, as evidenced by the popularity of the Oreo, are a classic favorite. They are not only easy to eat but also easy to and fun to bake.</dd>
					<dd>The filling of a sandwich cookie can be altered to match the holiday you are making them from. Chocolate dipped Oreo cookies are a decadent treat! In the chocolate sandwich cookies below, you can add some green or red food coloring to the filling then add crushed up candy canes for a great Holiday treat!</dd>

		<h2>Go Ahead, Eat It</h2>
		<p>Cookies in general are not considered to be particularly healthy food, due to their typically high sugar and calorie content. However, cookies made with oatmeal particularly those containing dried fruits such as raisins, dates or cranberries can provide a sweet fix without contributing too much fat or sugar to your diet. Additionally, oatmeal cookies are one of the relatively few sweet snacks to have a significant protein and iron content.</p>
